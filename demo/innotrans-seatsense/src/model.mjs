/**
 * Scenario model for the InnoTrans SeatSense demo.

 * Everything about the fictional operator lives here: network, timetable,
 * demand classes, fares, the sales policy and the 2026 SeatSense effect.
 * `generate.mjs` turns this into the JSON files under ../data. Nothing here is
 * real data.
 *
 * The story in one paragraph:
 *   Northbank Rail sells one seat per ticket and may not oversell. Its morning
 *   peak sells out every weekday and turns passengers away - and then departs
 *   with around a tenth of those paid-for seats empty, because the people who
 *   bought them did not turn up. Through 2025 the operator could not see any
 *   of that: ticket data knows exactly how many seats are unsold, but it
 *   cannot tell a passenger from a no-show, so it does not know how full any
 *   train actually is. SeatSense measures it from 1 January 2026. The empty
 *   seats themselves are not recoverable - a sold seat belongs to its buyer
 *   and overselling is not an option - so the entire value is in pricing the
 *   right departures, which is now possible because the operator finally knows
 *   which departures are genuinely full.

/**
 * The constraint that makes this a rail problem rather than an airline one.
 *
 * A European operator selling reserved seats sells at most one ticket per seat
 * per departure. A reservation is a contractual right to that specific seat,
 * and denied boarding triggers passenger-rights obligations, so the deliberate
 * overbooking an airline prices into its yield model is not available. Two
 * consequences run through the whole dataset:
 *
 *   - Sales stop at 100% of seated capacity. Demand above that is turned away
 *     and recorded in demand_turned_away, in both years.
 *   - A no-show seat is dead revenue. It cannot be resold, because it still
 *     belongs to the person who bought it, and it cannot be covered by
 *     overselling. Nothing SeatSense does recovers that seat.
 *
 * So the only lever measurement unlocks is price: knowing which departures are
 * genuinely full, rather than merely sold out, and pricing accordingly.

/**
 * Demand classes.
 *
 * `demandIndex` is mean weekday demand as a share of the route's *longest*
 * formation, before the 100% sales cap is applied. Measuring against the
 * longest formation rather than against the seats actually coupled up means the
 * number keeps its meaning when a departure runs short - and a value above 1.0
 * on a departure that runs the full formation means it sells out and turns
 * passengers away. Each route overrides these with its own `demandIndex`,
 * because the routes have genuinely different shapes; the values here are the
 * network default. `fareIndex` is the mean realised yield
 * per passenger as a fraction of the route's peak fare.
 *
 * `noShowRate` is the share of ticket holders who do not travel. It is the
 * same in both years by design: SeatSense measures no-shows, it does not
 * prevent them. In 2025 nobody could observe it, which is exactly why the
 * reported load factor was wrong.
 *
 * The 2026 columns are the pricing response, and they are deliberately small.
 * Fares here are regulated and publicly scrutinised; the demo's claim is not
 * that measurement permits a fare rise, but that it permits moving fares by
 * one or two percent on the *right* departures. `fareDelta2026` is the fare
 * move; `demandDelta2026` is the demand response to it.
 *
 * The elasticities are conservative on purpose. On the classes taking an
 * increase, demand falls by the same percentage as the fare rises - unit
 * elasticity, so on a departure with spare seats the move earns nothing. On
 * the discounted classes demand responds at about 1.5x the fare cut, which is
 * defensible only because the substitute is the adjacent departure of the same
 * journey rather than another mode.
 *
 * That is what makes the whole business case rest on capacity: only where the
 * 100% sales cap binds does a fare rise reach revenue without losing volume.
 * Getting that right requires knowing which departures are genuinely full,
 * which is exactly what ticket data cannot tell you.
